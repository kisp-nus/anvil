(** An {{!event_graph}event graph} is a DAG that describes the relationships between time points
(aka {{!event}events}).
Usually, an event graph corresponds to a looping thread, but this might not be the case
when there are cross-loop synchronisations through shared wires.
The edges between events provide a full description of when and the circumstances under which
each event is reached.
They also entail a {i no-later-than} partial order between events.

As the event graph is handy for analysing timing order, it is used for lifetime checking.

This module provides the related types.
